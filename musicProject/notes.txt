Home page 
- IsFeatured bool on albums (private, admin only). have page only display albums if(IsFeatured=true)
- Manually make home page with albums of my choice
	- My own reviews, "our picks" or something like that
	- Link to album
- Display top X amount by average score
	- could get messy if too many have same score

Check that onDelete action is properly set
- cascade will delete FK objects as well, no action will just delete selected
	- check every time you migrate, could reset to default
	- Track / Artist Id
	- in migration file and DbContext snapshot

Users
	- have user page w top rated albums and reviews (backlog)

Tracks
	add TrackList int to entity
	orderby(tracklist) to display in correct order
	currently you have to enter them in the correct order

Link CSS in _Layout page
